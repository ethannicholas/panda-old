Keywords
========

*Keywords* are reserved words defined by the Panda language. They may not be 
used as names for [classes](classes.html), [methods](methods.html), 
[variables](variables.html), or anywhere else an identifier is expected. Panda
reserves the following keywords:

* package
* uses
* as
* class
* method
* function
* constructor
* var
* def
* property
* constant
* do
* while
* for
* by
* loop
* if
* else
* switch
* case
* default
* self
* true
* false
* enum
* return
* break
* continue
* null
* new
* assert
* unreachable
* try
* catch
* finally
* throw
* super
* overflow

Additionally, several currently-unused words are reserved for possible future 
use:

* go
* to
* on
* at
* over
* annotation
* operator
* use
* using
* with
* repeat
* concurrent
* parallel
* serial
* from
* import
* lazy
* extend 

Note that there are no concrete plans surrounding any of these possible future
keywords; it just seemed like a good idea to have a few words set aside in case
they prove useful at some point.
