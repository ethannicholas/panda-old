Overview
========

Panda is a work-in-progress general-purpose programming language, featuring
things like preconditions / postconditions, immutable types, non-nullable 
references, tuples, and a lot more.

Panda is still under heavy development. A lot of things are working (including
a self-hosted compiler and both native-code and JVM output), but a couple of
important features are still missing (most notably generics) and the spec isn't
completely solidified yet. In other words, feel free to give it a try, but 
please understand that it's not ready for prime time yet.

Installation
============

To install Panda, see the 'INSTALL' file. Documentation lives under the 'docs'
directory (and final documentation is generated under the 'build/docs'
directory during the build process).

Note that Panda has only been tested under Mac OS X 10.8+ and Ubuntu 12.04+ so 
far. It will probably work under other Linuxes with relatively little effort, 
other Unixes with a bit more effort, and definitely will not work under 
Microsoft Windows yet. However, as Panda can also compile to JVM code and ships
with a JVM-compiled version of the compiler, you can at least play around with 
Panda on any platform with JVM support.

Panda was created by Ethan Nicholas, ethan@ethannicholas.com. Feel free to 
contact him with any questions / complaints / bug reports, or even to call him 
an idiot for thinking he could create a real programming language.

Panda would not have been possible without lots of other amazing open-source
projects, including:

    LLVM (http://llvm.org/)
    Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector (http://www.hboehm.info/gc/)
    ICU (http://site.icu-project.org/)
    V8-DTOA (https://code.google.com/p/v8/)
    SDL & SDL_image (https://www.libsdl.org/)
    Cairo (http://cairographics.org/)
