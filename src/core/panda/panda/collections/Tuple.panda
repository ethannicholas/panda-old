package panda.collections

================================================================================
The parent class of all mutable tuple types. Note that the tuples themselves are 
never actually modifiable, but objects must be considered mutable when they 
contain any mutable elements.

See [Tuples](../../../tuples.html) for more information about using arrays in
Panda.
