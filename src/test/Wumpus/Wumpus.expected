You're in a cave with 20 rooms and 3 tunnels leading from each room.
There are 3 bats and 3 pits scattered throughout the cave, and your
quiver holds 5 custom super anti-evil Wumpus arrows. Good luck.

You are in room 5 of the cave, and have 5 arrows left.
*sniff* (I can smell the evil Wumpus nearby!)
There are tunnels to rooms 13, 14, and 3.

A horrible roar fills the cave, and you realize, with a smile, that you
have slain the evil Wumpus and won the game!  You don't want to tarry for
long, however, because the stench of a dead Wumpus is also quite well
known, a stench powerful enough to slay the mightiest adventurer with
a single whiff!!
Care to play another game? (y/n)
