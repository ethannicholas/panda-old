================================================================================
The reference to "t.length" is ambiguous because the class has both a field and
a no-arg function by that name. Within the class, but outside of the method, the
reference should be interpreted as a call to the function.

class AmbiguousField {
    @private
    var length:Int := 5

    function length():Int {
        return 2
    }

    @class
    method main() {
        var t := AmbiguousField()
        Console.writeLine(t.length)
    }
}
